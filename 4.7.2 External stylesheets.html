    <h1> The Learn Enough Story</h1>
<p>
    Learn Enough to be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
    <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything
    error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there
    are <strong> at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication,
    probably more. To join our movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email"> sign up for our official email

    HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
        Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
    share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the web is also full of inspiring quotes, 
    perhaps none more so than this one:

        <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the internet.</em>
    </p>
